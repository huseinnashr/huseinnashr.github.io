I was so happy because it was my first time, but there's thing that i wished i knew beforehand.</p>\n<p>The first thing is don't use power merchant if it is not necessary. Power merchant is one of those badge that give you credibility by verifying your toko with KTP and selfie. But the downside here is that it cuts your profit out by 1.5% instead of 0.5%. 1% is good chunk of money, especially if you try to sell pricy item like laptop.</p>\n<p>When i was trying to sell the laptop, there was already a couple of people interested in buying and most of them offer a fair price. But i've upgraded anyway just out of curiosity. It didn't give me any benefit and it cost me like 150k short because of the 1% profit sharing increase</p>\n<p>The second thing is choose JNE only shipping if you want to ship with wooden packing and don't plan to D.I.Y the packing yourself. JNE offer packing option with an extra cost at least when i ship the laptop.</p>\n<p>When i was trying to sell the laptop, the buyer choose other shipping company because it was available as an option. It turns out the company didn't provide wooden packing as an option and i need to packed it myself. After i asked the Customer Service, i decided to go JNE. I was able to change the shipping method in tokopedia but i wasted like 100k. I also need to deliver the package to JNE myself instead of to be picked at home if use the chosen shipping method.</p>\n<p>Thanks Andi for tagging along</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 15, 2021","slug":"/blog/selling-laptop-with-tokopedia","title":"Selling laptop with Tokopedia, choose JNE!"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bc231655-beba-5068-9965-1b28854535d0","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/selling-laptop-with-tokopedia","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
